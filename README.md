# Compiler course code snippets

This repository contains course materials and code snippets that I developed to teach the compiler at Iran University of Science and Technology (UST).
Various language grammars have been written in ANTLR v4 format. 
For each grammar, the source code of generated Lexer and Parser is available in Python 3.8.x 
The repository is assumed to be updated regularly. 

It would be appreciated if you use our repository by forking it. 

For any question please contact me `m-zakeri[at]live.com` or read the [documentation](https://m-zakeri.github.io/IUSTCompiler/).


## Examples
The following outputs could be generated by code snippets in this repository.

### Three Addresses Codes
Figure 1 shows how a single pass compiler can generate three address code for assignment statements with *minimum* numbers of temporary variable, started with `T`:

**Fig 1: Examples of three addresses codes generated by ANTLR for AssignmentStatement grammar.**


### Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
Figure 2 demonstrates how a single pass compiler can generate *abstract syntax three (AST)* for assignment statements.

![abstract_syntax_three](./docs/figs/ast1.png)

**Fig 2: Examples of abstract syntax tree (AST) generated by ANTLR for AssignmentStatement grammar.**

The above tree corresponds to the following expressions: 

```
a1 := (2 + 12 * 3) / (6 - 19)

a2 := 2 + 3 * 4
```



## Structure

The following describes the structure of the repository:

### grammars

`gram1`: ANTLR hello world grammar.

`Expr1`: Simple grammar for handling mathematical expressions without any attribute and action.

`Expr2`: Simple attributed grammar for handling mathematical expressions with code() attribute.
 
`Expr3`: Currently, it is the same `Expr2` grammar.


`AssignmentStatement1.g4`: The grammar to handle multiple assignment statements and mathematical expressions in programming languages like *Pascal* and *C/C++*. 

`AssignmentStatement2.g4`: It is the same `AssignmentStatement1.g4` grammar with attributes for holding rule code and rule type.

`AssignmentStatement3.g4`: The grammar to handle multiple assignment statements and mathematical expressions in programming languages like *Pascal* and *C/C++*. It provides semantic rules to perform type checking and semantic routines to generate intermediate representation.

`AssignmentStatement4.g4`: The grammar to handle multiple assignment statements and mathematical expressions in programming languages like *Pascal* and *C/C++*. It provides semantic rules to perform type checking and semantic routines to generate intermediate representation. It has been implemented to generate intermediate representation (three addresses codes) with minimum number of "temp" variables. 


`CPP14_v2`: ANTLR grammar for C++14 forked from the official ANTRL website. Some bugs have been fixed and also the rule identifiers have been added to the grammar rules.

`EMail.g4`: Lexical grammar to validate email addresses.

`EMail2.g4`: Lexical grammar to validate email addresses, fixing bugs in `EMail.g4`



### language_apps

The `language_apps` package currently contains Lexer and Parser codes for each grammar in directory `grammars`, with a main driver script to demonstrate the *type checking* and *intermediate code generation* based on **semantic rules** and **semantic routines**. 

### terminal_batch_scripts

The `termina_batch_script` directory contains several batch script to run ANTLR in terminal (Windows) to generate target code in JAVA language.
The code snippets in this directory belong to my first experiences with ANTLR.
