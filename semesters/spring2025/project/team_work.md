# Teamwork Policy for Compiler Design Course Project

## Objective
To ensure effective collaboration, communication, and accountability among team members working on the Compiler Design Course Project focused on the generation of Three-Address Code for Mini-Java Language.

## Team Composition
- Each team must consist of **at most three members**.
- Teams should be formed based on _mutual agreement_ among members/students.
- Each member is expected to contribute equally to the project.

## Example of Roles and Responsibilities Assignments

### Team Leader
- Coordinates meetings and manages project timelines.
- Serves as the primary point of contact with the instructor.
- Ensures that tasks are assigned and deadlines are met.

### Developer 1
- Focuses on building the parser and lexer using ANTLR.
- Responsible for writing the ANTLR grammar file and generating the parser.

### Developer 2
- Works on semantic analysis and symbol table management.
- Implements type checking and scope resolution functionalities.

### Developer 3 (if applicable)
- Focuses on Three-Address Code generation and output formatting.
- Assists in testing and validation of the generated code.

*Note: Roles can be adjusted based on team preferences and strengths but must be discussed in the project final report.*

## Communication

### Regular Meetings
- Teams are required to meet at least once a week to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
- Meetings can be held in-person or virtually, depending on team preferences.

### Communication Channels
- Establish a preferred communication platform (_e.g._, Slack, Discord, email) for ongoing discussions and updates.
- Document important decisions and discussions in a shared document accessible to all members.

## Task Management

### Task Breakdown
- Divide the project into manageable tasks and assign them to team members based on their roles.
- Use project management tools (_e.g._, Trello, Asana, GitHub Projects) to track progress.

### Accountability
- Each member is responsible for completing their assigned tasks on time.
- Team members should support each other in overcoming challenges and ensuring project milestones are met.

## Conflict Resolution

### Open Communication
- Encourage open discussion of any conflicts or disagreements among team members.

### Mediation
- If conflicts cannot be resolved internally, seek assistance from the instructor or course facilitator for mediation.

## Submission and Documentation

### Collaborative Work
- All code and documentation should reflect the collaborative effort of the team.

### Version Control
- Use version control systems (_e.g._, Git) to manage code changes and maintain a history of contributions by each member.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Team performance will be evaluated based on:
  - Quality of contributions from each member.
  - Collaboration and communication effectiveness.
  - Adherence to deadlines and project milestones.

## Conclusion
This teamwork policy aims to foster a positive and productive working environment for all team members. By following these guidelines, teams can effectively collaborate on the Compiler Design Course Project, ensuring a successful outcome while enhancing individual learning experiences.
