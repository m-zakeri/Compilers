# Mini-Java compiler front-end development

The project includes parse tree and intermediate code generation (in form of C three addresses (TAC) code) for the [MiniJava](https://www.cambridge.org/resources/052182060X) or [eMiniJava](https://cs.rit.edu/~hh/teaching/cc17/eminijava) programming languages with [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/).


## Project Title
**Three-Address Code Generation for [MiniJava](https://www.cambridge.org/resources/052182060X/) Language Using [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/)**


## Introduction
The goal of this project is to design and implement a compiler that translates a subset of the Java programming language, referred to as [MiniJava](https://www.cambridge.org/resources/052182060X/) or [eMiniJava](https://cs.rit.edu/~hh/teaching/cc17/eminijava), into Three-Address Code (TAC) in C programming language. The project will involve constructing a parse tree, performing semantic analysis, and generating intermediate code that can be used for further compilation or execution.


## Objectives
1. **Define the [MiniJava](https://www.cambridge.org/resources/052182060X/) or [eMiniJava](https://cs.rit.edu/~hh/teaching/cc17/eminijava) Language**: Establish the syntax and semantics of the [MiniJava](https://www.cambridge.org/resources/052182060X/) language, including data types, control structures, and function definitions.
2. **Build a Parser Using [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/)**: Utilize [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) to create a parser that can read Mini-Java source code and produce a parse tree.
3. **Create a Semantic Analyzer**: Implement a semantic analysis phase to check for type correctness and scope resolution.
4. **Generate Three-Address Code**: Develop an intermediate code generation module that translates the parse tree into TAC in C language.
5. **Testing and Validation**: Test the compiler with various [MiniJava](https://www.cambridge.org/resources/052182060X/) programs to validate the correctness and efficiency of the generated TAC.
