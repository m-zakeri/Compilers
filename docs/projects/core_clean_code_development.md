# Core clean code development

The input to our software tool, _CleanCode_, is a c# class. 
cleanCode analyzes the source code and determines how clean the code is. 
The output is a list of the line numbers of the given class, in which the clean code principles proposed by Robert Martin, in his book, Clean Code, are violated. The current version of cleanCode, checks 14 principles and we are going to add more principles in our next version.
