# Teamwork Policy for Compiler Design Course Project

## Objective
To ensure effective collaboration, communication, and accountability among team members working on the Compiler Design Course Project focused on the generation of Three-Address Code for Mini-Java Language.

## Team Composition
- Each team must consist of **at most three members**.
- Teams should be formed based on _mutual agreement_ among members / students.
- Each member is expected to contribute equally to the project.

## Example of Roles and Responsibilities Assignments
- **Team Leader**: 
  - Coordinates meetings and manages project timelines.
  - Serves as the primary point of contact with the instructor.
  - Ensures that tasks are assigned and deadlines are met.

- **Developer 1**: 
  - Focuses on building the parser and lexer using ANTLR.
  - Responsible for writing the ANTLR grammar file and generating the parser.

- **Developer 2**: 
  - Works on semantic analysis and symbol table management.
  - Implements type checking and scope resolution functionalities.

- **Developer 3 (if applicable)**:
  - Focuses on Three-Address Code generation and output formatting.
  - Assists in testing and validation of the generated code.

(Note: Roles can be adjusted based on team preferences and strengths but must discuss in the project final report.)

## Communication
- **Regular Meetings**: 
  - Teams are required to meet at least once a week to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
  - Meetings can be held in-person or virtually, depending on team preferences.

- **Communication Channels**: 
  - Teams should establish a preferred communication platform (_e.g._, Slack, Discord, email) for ongoing discussions and updates.
  - Document important decisions and discussions in a shared document accessible to all members.

## Task Management
- **Task Breakdown**: 
  - Divide the project into manageable tasks and assign them to team members based on their roles.
  - Use project management tools (_e.g._, Trello, Asana, GitHub Projects) to track progress.

- **Accountability**: 
  - Each member is responsible for completing their assigned tasks on time.
  - Team members should support each other in overcoming challenges and ensuring project milestones are met.

## Conflict Resolution
- **Open Communication**: 
  - Encourage open discussion of any conflicts or disagreements among team members or even other teams.
  
- **Mediation**: 
  - If conflicts cannot be resolved internally, seek assistance from the instructor or course facilitator for mediation.

## Submission and Documentation
- **Collaborative Work**: 
  - All code and documentation should reflect the collaborative effort of the team.
  
- **Version Control**: 
  - Use version control systems (_e.g._, Git) to manage code changes and maintain a history of contributions by each member.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Team performance will be evaluated based on:
  - Quality of contributions from each member.
  - Collaboration and communication effectiveness.
  - Adherence to deadlines and project milestones.
  
## Conclusion
This teamwork policy aims to foster a positive and productive working environment for all team members. By following these guidelines, teams can effectively collaborate on the Compiler Design Course Project, ensuring a successful outcome while enhancing individual learning experiences.
