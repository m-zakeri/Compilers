Welcome to our online pamphlets for the Compiler Design Course! 🎉

This repository contains a collection of pamphlets that I've created to help others understand some of the fundamental concepts in compiler design. I've taken the time to edit and rewrite these pamphlets in a more friendly and engaging way, making them easier to understand and more approachable to beginners. 📝
